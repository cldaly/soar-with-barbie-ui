				<div class="bio-title">BARBARA PEREZ | SPIRITUAL COACH AND THETA HEALER&#174;</div>
				<p>
					I am now a Certified Theta Healing&#174; Instructor on the first 3 levels:<br><span>BASIC DNA, ADVANCED DNA, and DIG DEEPER</span><br><hr>
					The journey of life is filled with surprises, challenges, good times and not so great times. The most important lesson I have learned so far in my journey is to remember that we are
					spiritual beings that came here to have a physical experience and we must trust the process of life. If we can learn to live in a state of 100% certainty that no matter what is
					happening at the present moment there is a bigger picture and lesson to be learned, life will begin to effortlessly bend in our favor. Energy can always be changed to bring about a
					resolution or better feeling. We must be conscious and remember not to resist lifeâ€™s flows, but rather welcome them as we come to understand that there is a loving universal energy that
					will support us if we let it.
